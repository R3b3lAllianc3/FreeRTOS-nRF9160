 * @brief SystemInit function hook.
 *
 * This weak function allows to call specific initialization code during the
 * SystemInit() execution.This can be used when an application specific code needs
 * to be called as close to the reset entry as possible (for example the Multicore
 * Manager MCMGR_EarlyInit() function call).
 * NOTE: No global r/w variables can be used in this hook function because the
 * initialization of these variables happens after this function.
